# go_coffe_shop

Continuing my journey with Golang by building a simple coffee shop API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (optional)

### Installing

- Clone this repo
- Run `go mod download` to download all dependencies
- Run `go run main.go` to start the server

In this moment it is all, but I will add more information about how to use the API as I develop.
